"""Databricks Foundation Model API helpers.

This file is the only place where the project directly calls Databricks-hosted
AI models. It uses the Databricks SDK serving endpoint client instead of an
OpenAI-compatible helper so notebook jobs, Databricks Apps, and local runs all
follow the same Databricks authentication chain.

Models used by default:
- Embeddings: `databricks-qwen3-embedding-0-6b`
- Chat response: `databricks-meta-llama-3-3-70b-instruct`

Both values come from environment variables through `load_settings()`, so an
instructor can switch endpoints without changing source code.

    Why batching exists:
    - The dataset is small enough for a class project, but PDF chunking can
      still create hundreds of inputs.
    - Sending all chunks in one model request can create large payloads and make
      serverless notebook sessions less stable.
