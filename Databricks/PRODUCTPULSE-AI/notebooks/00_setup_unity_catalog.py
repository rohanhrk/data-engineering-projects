# Databricks notebook source
# ProductPulse AI - 00 setup Unity Catalog objects
#
# Purpose:
# Create the catalog/schema, a Unity Catalog volume for raw files, and Delta
# tables used by the rest of the project. This notebook is safe to rerun.
#
# Why this is separated as its own job:
# Governance objects should be created deliberately, not hidden inside the
# scheduled daily ingestion flow. Run this setup job manually first, then run it
# again only when the physical data model changes.

# COMMAND ----------

dbutils.widgets.text("catalog", "adidas_retail_ai", "Unity Catalog catalog")

# Widgets make the notebook reusable from both places:
# - the Databricks Jobs UI, where parameters can be changed before a run
# - the Databricks Asset Bundle, where the same values are passed automatically
catalog = dbutils.widgets.get("catalog")

# Unity Catalog hierarchy used by the project:
# - catalog: project-level governance boundary
# - schema: database-like namespace for ProductPulse tables
# - volume: governed object storage path for raw CSV, JSONL, and PDF files
